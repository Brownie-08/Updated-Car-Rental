# Car Rental System - Pre-Phase 1 QA Report

## 🚨 CRITICAL BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED

Before any testing can proceed, the following critical issues must be resolved:

### 1. Missing Dependencies (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Missing `django-environ` package**: Settings.py imports `environ` but the module is not installed
- ❌ **No requirements.txt file**: No dependency management in place
- ❌ **Unknown dependencies**: Cannot determine what packages are required

### 2. Database Configuration Issues (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Hardcoded MySQL credentials**: Database password is empty and credentials are hardcoded
- ❌ **No environment variable configuration**: Secrets exposed in settings.py
- ❌ **Database connection not tested**: Cannot verify if MySQL database exists or is accessible

### 3. Security Issues (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **Hardcoded SECRET_KEY**: Django secret key is exposed in settings.py
- ❌ **Hardcoded email credentials**: Gmail credentials are exposed in settings.py
- ❌ **DEBUG=True in production**: Debug mode enabled which is unsafe

### 4. Authentication Model Issues (HIGH)
- ❌ **CustomUser model not properly configured**: settings.py doesn't set AUTH_USER_MODEL
- ❌ **Mixed user model usage**: Views use django.contrib.auth.models.User while CustomUser exists
- ❌ **Inconsistent authentication flow**: Email verification is commented out

## 📋 FEATURE TESTING STATUS (Cannot proceed until blockers resolved)

## 🛠️ REQUIRED FIXES BEFORE TESTING

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Create requirements.txt**
   ```
   Django>=4.2.11
   django-crispy-forms
   reportlab
   mysqlclient
   django-environ
   Pillow
   ```

2. **Fix Settings Configuration**
   - Remove hardcoded SECRET_KEY
   - Remove hardcoded database credentials  
   - Remove hardcoded email credentials
   - Set proper AUTH_USER_MODEL
   - Configure environment variables

3. **Database Setup**
   - Verify MySQL server is running
   - Create database 'b_rental'
   - Test database connectivity
   - Run migrations

4. **Security Hardening**
   - Move all secrets to .env file
   - Set DEBUG=False for production
   - Configure proper ALLOWED_HOSTS

5. **Model Consistency**
   - Update all views to use CustomUser model consistently
   - Decide on authentication flow (with or without email verification)

## 🎯 TESTING PLAN (After fixes)

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality
1. Install dependencies and setup environment
2. Configure database and run migrations  
3. Create test admin and regular users
4. Test basic CRUD operations for cars
5. Test booking creation and management

### Phase 2: User Flows
1. Test complete registration/login flow
2. Test car browsing and filtering
3. Test booking creation with cost calculation
4. Test PDF receipt generation
5. Test admin dashboard functionality

### Phase 3: Edge Cases & Security
1. Test form validation and error handling
2. Test file upload functionality
3. Test pagination and search
4. Verify access controls and permissions
5. Test email functionality (if implemented)

## ⚠️ RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Cannot proceed with Phase 1 upgrades** until these blockers are resolved
2. **High priority**: Security fixes must be implemented immediately
3. **Medium priority**: Consistent user model usage across the application  
4. **Low priority**: UI/UX improvements can wait until Phase 1
